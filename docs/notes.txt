Spawn System
Check System
Task  System
Creep Control System


Creeps take tasks, not given tasks


Check Room
	Need Energy => Create Task
	Need Upgrade => Create Task
	Need Build => Create Task




ahh, i solved that by added lots of shared behaviours as new prototype functions on the game creep class. So i can go creep.getEnergy()
getEnergy() then is actually a collection of other extra funcs, such as harvestFromNearestSource() getFromClosetContainer() getFromTombstone() etc




getEnergy
    





Creeps harvest at 2 energy per tick per WORK Module

Source regens every 300 ticks
